judgments think form rods purpose comparison held together one end different ways take place give three figures since every premiss contains subject predicate two conceptions imagined situated two ends rod two judgments compared reference two different conceptions already said third conception must therefore subject comparison reference two compared middle latter accordingly always means chief concern two different conceptions hand subject reflection find relation means judgments contained aim syllogism therefore conclusion speaks middle means measuring rod let fall soon served end conception identical propositions thus middle subject one premiss conception compared must predicate conversely established priori possibility three cases either subject one premiss compared predicate subject one subject finally predicate one predicate hence arise three syllogistic figures aristotle fourth added somewhat impertinently ungenuine spurious form attributed galenus rests arabian authority three figures exhibits perfectly different correct natural thought process reason inference two judgments compared relation predicate one subject object comparison first figure appears figure alone advantage conceptions conclusion subject predicate appear already character premisses two figures one must always change roll conclusion thus first figure result always less novel surprising two advantage first figure obtained fact predicate major compared subject minor conversely therefore essential involves middle assume positions e subject major predicate minor arises subordinate significance appears mere weight lay pleasure one scale course thought figure predicate major attributed subject minor subject major predicate minor negative case converse holds reason thus property attributed things thought conception depends upon another property already know possess conversely therefore guiding principle nota est nota rei ipsius et repugnans repugnat rei ipsi hand compare two judgments intention bringing relation subjects may must take common measure predicate accordingly middle must therefore judgments hence arises second figure relation two subjects determined common predicate relation significance predicate attributed one subject denied thus becomes essential ground distinction two attributed subjects could decide nothing relation almost every

therefore principal rule sit altera negans corollary e meris affirmativis nihil sequitur rule sometimes transgressed loose argument obscured many parenthetical propositions course thought figure

two predicates result account one premiss must negative buddhist believes god buddhists rational therefore rational beings believe god examples given compatibility two properties problem reflection separableness problem also must decided comparing one subject showing one present without thus end directly attained means first figure could attained indirectly order reduce syllogism first figure must convert minor therefore say rational beings buddhists would faulty expression meaning really buddhists yet certainly rational guiding principle figure therefore give affirmative moods ejusdem rei

satisfaction reason found base conviction truth theorem upon reason alone longer upon reason knowing given us demonstration let us instance take sixth proposition first book euclid two angles triangle equal sides also subtend opposite equal angles shall equal one another see fig illustration fig euclid demonstrates follows let b c triangle angle b c equal angle c b side c must equal side b also side b equal side c one greater let b greater c b cut b equal c draw c triangles b c b c b equal c b c common triangles two sides b b c equal two sides c b angle b c equal angle c b therefore base c equal base b triangle b c equal triangle b c less triangle equal greater absurd therefore b unequal c b equal c demonstration reason knowing truth proposition bases conviction geometrical truth upon proof rather base conviction upon reason know intuitively according necessity admits demonstration evidence intuition two lines drawn extreme ends another line inclining equally towards meet point equally distant extremities since two arising angles properly one oppositeness position gives appearance two wherefore reason lines meet point nearer one end knowledge reason shows us necessary consequence conditioned condition instance lateral equality angular equality shows connection whereas reason knowing shows coexistence nay might even maintain usual method proving merely convinces us

certainly evident cases simple theorems like th one euclid still persuaded might brought evidence every theorem however complicated proposition always reduced simple intuition besides conscious priori necessity reason relation space necessity cause change complicated theorems course difficult show reason place difficult geometrical researches therefore make meaning somewhat clearer try bring back reason moderately complicated proposition nevertheless reason immediately evident passing intermediate theorems take th every triangle one side produced exterior angle greater either interior opposite angles euclid demonstrates following manner see fig illustration fig let b c triangle let side b c produced exterior angle c shall greater either interior opposite angles b c c b bisect side c e join b e produce b e f making e f equal e b join f c produce c g e equal e c b e e f two sides e e b equal two sides c e e f angle e b equal angle c e f opposite vertical angles therefore base b equal base c f triangle e b equal triangle c e f remaining angles one triangle remaining angles equal sides opposite therefore angle b e equal angle e c f angle e c greater angle e c f therefore angle c greater angle b c manner side b c bisected side c produced g may demonstrated angle b c g opposite vertical angle c greater angle b c demonstration proposition would follows see fig illustration fig angle b c even equal let alone greater angle c line b toward c would lie direction b precisely meant equality angles e must parallel b say b b must never meet order form triangle must meet reason must thus contrary would required angle b c size angle c angle b c even equal let alone greater angle c line b must lie direction towards b c meant equality angles e must parallel c say b c must never meet order form triangle b c must meet must thus contrary would required angle b c size c mean suggest introduction new method mathematical demonstration substitution proof euclid whole nature unfits well fact presupposes conception parallel lines euclid comes much later merely wished show reason wherein lies difference reason knowing latter effects convictio thing differs entirely insight reason fact
